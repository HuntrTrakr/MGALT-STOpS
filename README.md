# MGALT STOpS
This MATLAB code was used by Malloy in his thesis titled "Spacecraft Trajectory Optimization Suite (STOpS): Design and Optimization of Multiple Gravity-Assist Low-Thrust (MGALT) Trajectories Using Modern Optimization Techniques". This code is the continuation of work done by Fitzgerald and Sheehan with the MGALT and Low-Thrust problems respectively.

<!-- # Motivation -->
<!-- A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. -->
<!-- This should explain **why** the project exists. -->

<!-- # Installation -->
<!-- Provide step by step series of examples and explanations about how to get a development env running. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- # How to Use? -->
<!-- If people like your project theyâ€™ll want to learn how they can use it. To do so include step by step guide to use your project. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- # Code Example -->
<!-- Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. -->
<!-- Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- # API Reference -->
<!-- Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. -->
<!-- For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live. -->
